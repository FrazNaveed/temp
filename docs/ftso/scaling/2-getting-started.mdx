To read an anchor feed, you need to follow three key steps:

1. **Query ScalingLayer:** You can use any of the URLs listed under, or even run you own ScalingLayer by following the ScalingLayer guide.
   The ScalingLayer will return the anchor feeds along with a proof.

2. **Verify ScalingLayer Result:** Since the ScalingLayer result is served off-chain, you can either:

   Verify the proofs on-chain using the `FtsoFeedVerifier` contract.

   **OR**

   Verify the proofs off-chain by reading the output of the `Relay` contract.

## Query ScalingLayer

With Scaling, you have to fetch the price and the proof off-chain. This can be acheived using ScalingLayer.
For example, to get the prices for FLR/USD, ETH/USD and BTC/USD, query the `feeds-with-proof` GET endpoint follows:

```bash
curl -X 'GET' 'https://API_URL//feeds-with-proof/0x014254432f55534400000000000000000000000000/648538' -H 'accept: application/json'
```

This will return something like the following JSON responce:

```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "feedWithProof": {
    "body": {
      "votingRoundId": 648538,
      "id": "0x014254432f55534400000000000000000000000000",
      "value": 6885054,
      "turnoutBIPS": 9999,
      "decimals": 2
    },
    "proof": [
      "0xa2da758620f31407933462306a2d45120e70a3db971d95486a3d69cbc497f6bc",
      "0xa453ae63c3b84dc8239f1bff59a41c2a9833add385266808423463b9edaa7cbd",
      "0xbdd2d87b8335993031a643c22e1a45d7745902e929e655f04a044b248b9302c7",
      "0xcf94c0655b58f0a74bcc97cea9a6e8556cf0849871b9b868268e0e80a223ef1f",
      "0x92d7c8921dadfbf8c4521bdcc38ba240e51830972929185b2b1e8aaba707fa4c",
      "0xc2d4e23727d8d90b95b85e8c1c437f69ece3f378a72773260457ba2d4040e41a"
    ]
  }
}
```

You can use the `proof` parameter to verify the prices on- or off-offchain.

### Verify on-chain

#### IFTSOFeedVerifier

Let's take a look at the `IFTSOFeedVerifier` interface that is used to verify the price data.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity >=0.7.6 <0.9;

interface IFTSOFeedVerifier {
    struct Feed {
        uint32 votingRoundId;
        bytes21 id;
        int32 value;
        uint16 turnoutBIPS;
        int8 decimals;
    }

    struct FeedWithProof {
        bytes32[] proof;
        Feed body;
    }

    function get_ftso_protocol_feed_id() external view returns (uint256);

    function verifyPrice(
        FeedWithProof calldata _feed_data
    ) external view returns (bool);
}
```

This interface is used to verify the price data that is provided by the FTSO protocol.
Don't worry, the implementation is already available on chain ([coston link](https://coston-explorer.flare.network/address/0x206e99eC6598aC89F6Ce84bDdBd71b40BD874BF1)) and the interface is available in the updated periphery package, from where the code above is copied.
FTSO is now part of the FSP protocol and has a specific protocol feed id that distinguishes it from other feeds.
In our case, that id is `100`, but it's recommended to use the provided getter to get the correct id - so you don't need to remember it.

The most important thing to us is the `FeedWithProof` struct that contains the price data and the Merkle proof that can be used to verify the price data.
The struct contains two fields, where `Feed` is the price data and `proof` is the Merkle proof that can be used to verify the price data.
The `Feed` part should be easy to decipher.
Compared to the FTSOv1 it contains a lot more information.
Now, you can access the price and decimals easily in the same struct, while also getting the voting round id (when the price was selected), the turnout - how many data providers actively provided the price and the id of the feed.
If id of the field is a bit confusing, don't worry, we will come back to it later and explain exactly how to use it.
Importantly, the price can now be negative, as the protocol can now support assets that have a negative value (EURIBOR looking at you).

So we now have a struct from where we get the price data and the proof to verify it.
But how do we do that?
Well, we have to make sure, that the Merkle proof together with feed data hashes to exactly the root accepted in the FTSO protocol.
One can do this by himself, but you can also used the provided `verifyPrice` function that does this for you.
As the feed already contains the voting round id, the method already knows which root it has to use and we don't need to provide any additional information.
For those that are interested in the implementation, it's available in the periphery package and can be found [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flarenetwork/flare-periphery-contracts?activeTab=code), but it just calls `openzeppelin`'s `MerkleProof` library to verify the proof and `Relay` to get the root.
