You can use FTSOv2 to connect your smart contracts with real-world data feeds. FTSOv2 leverages Flare's network of 100 independent data providers to fetch off-chain data and deliver it on-chain. This section demonstrates how to consume FTSOv2's block-latency feeds on Flare using an on-chain Solidity contract.

## Sample contract

This example smart contract queries the latest feed values for FLR/USD, BTC/USD, and ETH/USD from FTSOv2 on Flare Testnet Coston2.

<CodeBlock language="solidity" title="FtsoV2FeedConsumer.sol">
  {FtsoV2FeedConsumer}
</CodeBlock>

<details>
<summary>Breaking down the contract.</summary>

- **Purpose**: Interacts with the Flare Network to fetch current feed values for specific cryptocurrency pairs (FLR/USD, BTC/USD, ETH/USD).

- **Dependencies**:

  - `IFlareContractRegistry`: Interface to get contract addresses from the Flare Network registry.
  - `IFastUpdater`: Interface to fetch current feed values.

- **State Variables**:

  - `contractRegistry`: Instance of `IFlareContractRegistry` to access the contract registry.
  - `ftsoV2`: Instance of `IFastUpdater` to fetch feed values.
  - `feedIndexes`: Array of feed indexes ([0, 2, 9]) representing FLR/USD, BTC/USD, ETH/USD.

- **Constructor**:

  - Initializes `contractRegistry` with a hardcoded address. This address is the same on mainnet and testnet.
  - Retrieves and sets the `ftsoV2` contract address using the contract registry.

- **Function `getFtsoV2CurrentFeedValues`**:

  - Fetches the current feed values, decimals, and timestamp.
  - Returns the fetched values.

## Compile, deploy, and run the contract

If you have not already configured your MetaMask wallet to support Flare Testnet Coston2 and funded it with testnet C2FLR, learn how to [deploy your first smart contract](/network/getting-started).

You can get testnet C2FLR from the [Coston2 Faucet](https://faucet.flare.network/coston2).

1. <Remix gist="d6181b71e7932701efbc6c3c78898f5a">Open contract in Remix</Remix>

2. Click on `FtsoV2FeedConsumer.sol` in the file explorer to open the contract in the editor.

2. On the left side of Remix, click the **Solidity Compiler** tab to view the compiler settings.

   <img src={OpenSolidityCompiler} style={{ width: 300 }} />

3. Expand the **Advanced Configurations** section and make sure the **EVM Version** is set to `london`.

   <img src={SetEvmVersion} style={{ width: 300 }} />

3. Click the **Compile FtsoV2FeedConsumer.sol** button to compile the contract.

    <img src={CompileContract} style={{ width: 300 }} />

4. On the left side of Remix, click the **Deploy & Run transactions** tab to view the deployment settings.

   <img src={OpenDeploy} style={{ width: 300 }} />

5. Select the **Injected Provider - MetaMask** environment.

   <img src={SetInjectedProvider} style={{ width: 300 }} />

6. Click **Deploy** to deploy the contract to Flare Testnet Coston2. MetaMask opens and asks you to confirm payment for deploying the contract. Make sure MetaMask is set to Flare Testnet Coston2 before you confirm the transaction.

    <img src={DeployContract} style={{ width: 300 }} />

7. In the MetaMask prompt, click **Confirm** to approve the transaction and spend your testnet C2FLR required to deploy the contract.

    <img src={ConfirmDeployInMetamask} style={{ width: 300 }} />

8. After a few seconds, the transaction completes and your contract appears under the **Deployed/Unpinned Contracts** list in Remix. Click the contract dropdown to view its variables and functions. Click on **getFtsoV2CurrentFeedValues** to show the latest feed values and decimals.

    <img src={QueryLatestFeeds} style={{ width: 300 }} />

#### Function Returns

- `_feedValues`: Current integer values of FLR/USD, BTC/USD, and ETH/USD. The returns are in the same order as the input `feedIndexes` array.
- `_decimals`: Decimal places for FLR/USD, BTC/USD, and ETH/USD.
- `_timestamp`: Timestamp of the last feed update.

The floating point price of a feed can be calculated by dividing the `feedValue` by 10^`decimals`. For example, if the feed value of BTC/USD is `6900420` and the decimal is `2`, the floating point feed value is `69004.20`.
